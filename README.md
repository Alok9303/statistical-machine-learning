# Statistical Machine Learning

A simple collection of my practice notebooks and experiments while learning **statistical machine learning**. This repository contains small datasets, exploratory data analysis, and implementations of different ML models.

## 📚 What this repo includes

* Practice notebooks on statistical ML concepts
* Model fitting experiments (regression, classification, etc.)
* Small datasets used for learning
* Notes and observations from each experiment

## 🎯 Purpose

This repository is mainly for:

* Learning and practicing statistical ML
* Understanding how different ML models behave on small datasets
* Building confidence with hands‑on experimentation

## 🛠 Technologies Used

* Python
* NumPy, Pandas
* Matplotlib / Seaborn
* Scikit‑learn

## 🚀 Future Plans

* Add more ML models
* Try evaluation techniques and metrics
* Improve visualizations
* Add more structured notes

## 🤝 Contributions

This is a personal learning repo, but suggestions are always welcome!
