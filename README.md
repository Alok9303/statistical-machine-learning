# Statistical Machine Learning

This repository contains hands-on implementations of **statistical and classical machine learning algorithms** using Python.  
It is created for learning, practicing, and understanding the core concepts behind machine learning models through simple and clear notebooks.

---

## Repository Overview

The repository covers the following areas of machine learning:

- Supervised Learning
- Unsupervised Learning
- Ensemble Methods
- Regularization Techniques
- Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
- Model Evaluation
- Hyperparameter Tuning
- Time Series Basics

All models are implemented using **scikit-learn** with supporting libraries for data analysis and visualization.
